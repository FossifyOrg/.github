## Most Asked Questions

### It's safe use Simple Mobile Tools apps from F-droid?

Yes, it's safe. They have disabled AUM (AutoUpdateMode - auto-generating new builds when new releases are available), so you don't get new versions with ads from ZipoApps. https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14135

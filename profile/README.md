## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Fossify!

Fossify is a group of privacy-focused, open-source, and ad-free mobile apps. 

It emerged as a fork of the popular but [discontinued](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues/241) SimpleMobileTools and we're here to continue the legacy, bringing simple and private tech to everyone.

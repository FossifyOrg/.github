# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to Fossify!

Fossify is all about community-backed, open-source, and ad-free mobile apps. It emerged as a fork of the popular but [discontinued](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues/241) SimpleMobileTools and we're here to continue the legacy, bringing simple and private tech to everyone.

For issues affecting multiple apps or the entire project, check out [general issues](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/General-Discussion/issues). Engage in discussions about various aspects of the project at [general discussions](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/General-Discussion/discussions).
